# ml-algo-implementations-writeups

## Who am I?

My name is Berkay Canogullari. I'm currently pursuing my M.S. in Data Science at the University of San Francisco, which I will be graduating in mid-August. At the same time, I'm working as a Machine Learning Researcher at the University of California, San Francisco.


## About the repo

Throughout my M.S. program, I implemented many ML algorithms from scratch in Python to showcase my OOP skills and wrote about some important ML techniques. At the request of my professors Terence Parr and Yannet Interian, codes and writeups are not publicly available, but I am allowed to share with potential employers.

## Algorithm implementations and Writeups

*All Implementations are coded in Python*

1) L1, L2 and Linear Regression
2) Logistic Regression
3) TFIDF
4) Naive Bayes
5) Decision Trees
6) Random Forest
7) AdaBoost
8) GBDT w/ MSE loss
9) k-means clustering implementation and writeup
10) feature importance implementation and writeup
